            <a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/myprint">Brown MyPrint</a> is a campus-wide printing interface at Brown University. Students log in with their Brown ID card to release documents they have previously sent to print. To better understand user needs and experiences with MyPrint, I observed and interviewed three students printing at Page-Robinson Hall. By combining these observations and interviews, I developed personas and storyboards to identify patterns in user experience.

        <h2 class="py-4">MyPrint Interface</h2>
        <p>
          The MyPrint device consists of a touch screen and card reader attached to the print machine. Using the touch screen, the student can interact with different print functions. These functions include, but are not limited to: number of copies, color scale, size of content, and double-sided printing. The card reader is used for authentication, once a Brown ID card is swiped the device will login as that student.

      <div class="card p-3 mb-3 shadow">
        <h2 class="py-4">Observing and Interviewing MyPrint Users</h2>

        <!-- List of questions -->
        <p>I observed 3 users releasing documents to print. After observing each participant, I asked them the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What was your goal today when using the print machine? Were you able to do everything you needed to?</li>
          <li>Did the screen include all the necessary options to complete your goal? If not, what was missing?</li>
          <li>How often do you print at Brown?</li>
          <li>What are you most likely to print?</li>
          <li>Did you experience any challenges?</li>
          <li>Anything else you would like to add about your experience?</li>
          <li>What is your affiliation to Brown?</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Observations -->
        <p>I gathered the following notes from my observations of student use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users 1 & 2 signed into the device and did not see any documents for print release, and had to leave the print interface to re-send documents on their personal devices. </li>
          <li>Users 2 & 3 ended their MyPrint experience by logging out, but User 1 did not log out and simply walked away from the device.</li>
          <li>Users 1-3 began the interaction by immediately signing into the interface by swiping their Brown ID.</li>
          <li>Users 1 & 2 only pressed “Print All” on the device to release their print.</li>
          <li>User 3 began the interaction by signing in and then changing the paper in the machine (brought their own paper).</li>
          <li>User 3 explored options under ‘Device Function’ and ‘Print Release’ to configure print settings before printing.</li>
          <li>Users 1 & 2 printed a single-page document each.</li>
          <li>User 3 printed over 30 copies of the same document, then closely analyzed the printed documents.</li>
          <li>User 3 printed in color.</li>
          <li>Users 1 & 2 printed in Black and White. User 1’s original document was in color but printed in Black and White.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Interview Patterns -->
        <p> After observing, I asked each person the interview questions that I designed and noticed a few common themes, and gained additional insights from individual users. Please view the interview summary below. </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
              <p><strong>What was your goal today when using the print machine? Were you able to do everything you needed to?</strong></p>
              <p>All participants shared that their main goal was to print using the machine, and gave some insight as to what they were printing: fisher’s license, to-do list, handouts for a student-led workshop. All participants also confirmed that they were eventually able to achieve their goal, but expressed frustration with the interface that challenged them. The challenges shared were a combination of actions taken before interacting with the MyPrint device (sending documents, designing for print colors) and how this affected their actions when interacting with the MyPrint device. A pattern here is that when users are printing for themselves, they are pretty complacent with the print, but when printing for others, they are more particular about the printed documents.</p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
              <p><strong>Did the screen include all the necessary options to complete your goal? If not, what was missing?</strong></p>
              <p>Users 1-2 expressed that they were first-time users and were confused by the process of sending documents to the printer because they thought authentication was completed when swiping their card on the MyPrint interface. They did not realize they needed to log into their Brown ID on their personal devices to send the document. Users 1 and 2 explained that they started asking each other for help due to their confusion and would have preferred a better feedback loop. User 3 had issues selecting the correct color scale and adjusting margins for the special paper she loaded, and she would have preferred better descriptions for advanced print options. Overall, all participants would have liked more descriptions and feedback between their personal devices and the print machine.</p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
              <p><strong>How often do you print at Brown?</strong></p>
              <p>Users 1-2 typically don’t print and said they only print if they have to (e.g., when a physical copy is required or for the gratification of physically crossing out a to-do list). It was also their first time using a Brown printer. User 3 prints frequently, as she often leads workshops with other students and finds it helpful for them to have a printout to follow along.</p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
              <p><strong>What are you most likely to print?</p></strong>
              <p>Users 1-2 did not have a complete answer because they rarely print. User 3 prints whenever she is leading a workshop, as it is part of her role on the executive board of her group.</p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
              <p><strong>Did you experience any challenges?</strong></p>
              <p>As noted earlier, Users 1-2 reiterated issues with sending documents to the printer. User 3 expanded on the print settings, explaining that she expected the colors to be lighter, but when translating the colors from her Canva design, they printed darker, raising concerns about legibility. She also noticed some of her design was cut off due to the margin settings and immediately regretted not printing a test copy first.</p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
              <p><strong>Anything else you would like to add about your experience?</strong></p>
              <p>User 2 mentioned that the "Swipe to Login" graphic did not clearly indicate that users needed to swipe, which might be confusing for students whose primary language is not English. User 3 said the interface was generally easy to use since she prints often but found the advanced options frustrating to navigate.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><strong>What is your affiliation to Brown?</strong></p>
            <p>All users are students. Users 1-2 are graduate students and User 3 is an undergraduate a part of 2 student-led organizations.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <!-- Personas -->

        <h2 class="py-4">Personas</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Personas are user models represented as specific, individual human beings. Based on the interviews and user observations, I constructed two personas for MyPrint users: Over It Olivia and Passionate Penelope. Each persona is communciated via an empathy map, the map has four quardrants to explain what the user model thinks, feels, says, and does.

                  <h2 class="py-4">Passionate Penelope Persona</h2>
                  <p><strong>Passionate Penelope</strong> is a Teaching Assistant at Brown that often leads interactive workshops, she finds it most helpful to include a physical document for each student to understand class concepts better.</p>

                            <li>Excited that she will postively impact the student experience, and remember how hard these concepts were when she took the class,.</li>

                  </div>
                  <p>The Passionate Penelope is modeled after a more experienced MyPrint user (User 3) and that is also the author of the document printed (User 2-3). Penelope is printing a document for others, and is also a student leader like User 3. She is paticular about how documents look because they are for a wider audience and she would like students to be able to learn from the document printed. She takes pride in her work, and carefully created the document herself - this is similar to User 3 who was leading a workshop, wanted to use special paper and curated a guide to print out. Since she is printing multiple documents, she is at the printer longer.</p>

          <p><strong>Over it Olivia</strong> is a student at Brown that relies on technology for most communication but she is going skiing and the resort requires a printed health waiver at entry so she is using MyPrint for the first time.</p>

          <p>Over it Olivia persona is constructed from patterns found in first-time users. Both Users 1-2 were first time users that had trouble sending documents to the printer and rarely print. This is reflected in Olivia's frustrations when her document aren't available to print. Olivia also reflects the significantly shorter time spent interacting with the interface that User 1-2 experienced, they only clicked on button to print. Lastly, User 1 mentioned she was required to print and that is what brought her to the MyPrint for the first time - so Olivia also is a first-time required printer.</p>
          <h2 class="py-4">Over It Olivia Storyboard</h2>
          <p> A storyboard is meant to set interaction story of the entire user's journey from start to end. This will include communicating the user's goals and neccesary steps for using the interface. The storyboad below is crafter based on the Over It Olivia persona.

        <div>
          <p>
            As a certified graphic designer and print maker, it was hard to create personas with an objective perspective because I know so much about printing compared to users that are printing for personal use and not production. However, by remaining objective I was able to engage deeply with the user through observations and interviews. Overall, I am passionate about user centered design and hope to have more opprutnities to engage with real-world users in the future.
